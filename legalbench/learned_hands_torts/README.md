## Task Description

This is a binary classification task in which the model must determine if a user's legal question discusses problems that one person has with another person (or animal), like when there is a car accident, a dog bite, bullying or possible harassment, or neighbors treating each other badly.

## Task Construction

This task was constructed from the [LearnedHands](https://suffolklitlab.org/) dataset. Please see their website for more information on annotation. Our task consists of a binarized version of the original dataset, with "negatives" randomly sampled from posts with other topics. This dataset is class balanced.
