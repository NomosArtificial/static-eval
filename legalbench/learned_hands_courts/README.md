## Task Description

This is a binary classification task in which the model must determine if a user's post discusses the logistics of how a person can interact with a lawyer or the court system. It applies to situations about procedure, rules, how to file lawsuits, how to hire lawyers, how to represent oneself, and other practical matters about dealing with these systems.

## Task Construction

This task was constructed from the [LearnedHands](https://suffolklitlab.org/) dataset. Please see their website for more information on annotation. Our task consists of a binarized version of the original dataset, with "negatives" randomly sampled from posts with other topics. This dataset is class balanced.
