       "   'generated_output': \"Alice has to pay $798.60 in tax for 2019. \\n\\nExplanation: \\n\\nAccording to §3301, Alice's employer would have to pay a tax of 6% on the total wages paid to Alice. However, this does not affect Alice's personal income tax liability. \\n\\nAlice's taxable income would be determined according to §1 and §63. As Alice is not married, does not have any dependents, and is not a head of household, her tax rate would be determined under §1(c) for unmarried individuals. \\n\\nAccording to §63, Alice's taxable income is her adjusted gross income minus the standard deduction. Alice's adjusted gross income is the total income she earned in 2019, which is $1200 + $5320 = $6520. \\n\\nAccording to §63(c) and §63(g), the standard deduction for an individual who is not married is $12,000 for the years 2018 through 2025.\",\n",
